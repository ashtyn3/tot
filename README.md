*The other typeracer... but in your terminal!*

Tot is the easy to play game that anyone with a keyboard can win at.

[Tot example video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63922318/120110471-9dd2c800-c13b-11eb-9b0a-f8e3316e2518.mp4)

No more **hassle** trying to open a web browser to shrek your friends at typeracer. Now the programmers dream has come true you can play a typing game in the terminal.

To start up tot locally you need to have a redis database started. All you have to do then is put the host address and the password into a .env file in the base of the project.

Your .env file should look something like this:

```
rd_endpoint="HOST_ADDRESS:PORT"
rd_pwd="PASSWORD"
```
